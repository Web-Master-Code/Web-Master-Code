                                never written a line of code. I needed
                                some structure from professionals
                                who can help me learn programming
                                step by step. I was encouraged to
                                enroll by a former student of theirs
                                who can only say wonderful things
                                about the program. The entire
                                curriculum and staff did not
                                disappoint. They were very hands-on
                                and I never had to wait long for
                                assistance. The agile team project, in
                                particular, was outstanding. It took
                                my learning to the next level in a way
                                that no tutorial could ever have. In
                                fact, I've often referred to it during
                                interviews as an example of my
                                developent experience. It certainly
                                helped me land a job as a full-stack
                                developer after receiving multiple
                                offers. 100% recommend!"</span>
